INSERT RESULTS HERE\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Introduction\n\n(1-2 paragraphs): Brief introduction to the dataset. You may repeat some of the information about the dataset provided in the introduction to the dataset on the TidyTuesday repository, paraphrasing on your own terms. Imagine that your project is a standalone document and the grader has no prior knowledge of the dataset.\n\nOur main dataset is the `chocolate` dataset. It contains information about chocolate bars and reviews written by experts. It contains 10 variables with 1795 observations. This dataset contains information about the company who makes the chocolate bars, the percent of cocoa, where the company is located, bean type & origin, expert review (out of 5 stars), and the date and reference number for each review. The original data source can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/willcanniford/chocolate-bar-ratings-extensive-eda/data) and more in depth information can be found in our data dictionary located in `data/README.md` in this repository.\n\nOur other datasets include `world` and `con2cont` and they are primarily used in our plots that include geospatial variables. `con2cont` maps countries to continents while the `world` dataset gives us coordinates to graph so that we can make map-like visualizations.\n\n## Question 1: What characteristics lead to the most successful chocolate bars?\n\n### Introduction\n\n(1-2 paragraphs): Introduction to the question and what parts of the dataset are necessary to answer the question. Also discuss why you're interested in this question.*DELETE THIS LATER*\n\nWe aim to explore what characteristics of chocolate bars are the most successful as rated out of 5 stars by experts. This information is important for consumers so when they are in the candy aisle at grocery stores faced with dozens of options, they can use these findings to make a well-informed decision about which chocolate they should buy. This is also important for chocolate makers to understand so that they can use this information to improve their own chocolate given the location preferences.\n\nTo answer what characteristics lead to the most successful chocolate bars we will use the variables that describe cocoa percentage in the chocolate, the various companies who are included in this dataset, the origin of the cocoa beans that are used to produce that chocolate bar, and the expert reviews of the chocolate bars.\n\n### Approach\n\n(1-2 paragraphs): Describe what types of plots you are going to make to address your question. For each plot, provide a clear explanation as to why this plot (e.g.Â boxplot, barplot, histogram, etc.) is best for providing the information you are asking about. The two plots should be of different types, and at least one of the two plots needs to use either color mapping or facets.*DELETE THIS LATER*\n\n#### Plot 1.1\n\nFor this first plot, we wanted to vizualize how the cocoa percent in a chocolate bar affects the expert review based on where the chocolate company is located. We believe that there might be general trends for each country that lead to chocolate being more highly rated if the population preferred a specific cocoa percentage. For example, we know Americans have a strong preference for sweeter, less cocoa- filled chocolate and wanted to know if a decrease in cocoa percentage would lead to an increase in reviews.\n\nTo visualize this, we first created a scatterplot to get a general idea of the relationship between a country, their preference for cocoa, and how that might affect the rating. The points were somewhat all stacked on top of each other since a lot of observations had very similar positions. This made it hard to see overall relationships so we made the points a bit transparent to better communicate more frequent cocoa percentage and rating pairings through more concentrated colors. Then we layered trend lines over our scatterplot for 8 countries that are best known for the chocolate they produce (according to outside research). We also chose these countries because they had over 30 companies who manufactured and sold their chocolate there so we thought we would get a pretty representative sample of companies for each country.\n\n#### Plot 1.2\n\nFor this second plot, we thought it would be interesting to observe the relationship between the origin of cocao beans and the expert reviews. Furthermore, given how neighboring countries often have similar climates we believe that preferences for beans from nearby countries should be similar. In order to investigate these relationships we decided to create a map.\n\nThe map was created using the maps package, as inspired by https://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/making-maps-with-R.html. We left_joined the world data set with the average rating for each country from the chocolate data set. This new dataset contained the latitude and longitude coordinates from the world data set which allow us to use the geom_polygon function to create the baseline for the map. The countries were then colored based on rating to show the preferences for their bean origin. Finally, we decided to add labels for certain countries. We tried many variations of labels so that the plot was not cluttered but still provided additional information. These labels chose highlight which countries were the most popular, further showing which areas contained the most popular bean origins.\n\n### Analysis\n\n(2-3 code blocks, 2 figures, text/code comments as needed): In this section, provide the code that generates your plots. Use scale functions to provide nice axis labels and guides. You are welcome to use theme functions to customize the appearance of your plot, but you are not required to do so.

Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.\n\nThe second plot does reveal a spatial clustering that we expected. The countries that produce cocoa beans exist in two man areas, Central/ South America and Southeast Asia. However, there is no specific area that stands out as the best for producing cocoa beans. There are 5 countries from each area that make up the top 10, and there are also come of the worst performing cocoa beans in these regions. It is likely that cocoa does require specific conditions for growth but seemingly as long those conditions are met the preferences for beans has more to do with specific processes within the countries then climate related.\n\n## Question 2: Title that relates to the question you're answering\n\n### Introduction\n\n(1-2 paragraphs): Introduction to the question and what parts of the dataset are necessary to answer the question. Also discuss why you're interested in this question.\n\n### Approach\n\n(1-2 paragraphs): Describe what types of plots you are going to make to address your question.

The two plots should be of different types, and at least one of the two plots needs to use either color mapping or facets.\n\nTo create the first plot, we created line plots by year that show the relationship between the cocoa percentage of the chocolate bar and their ratings. In creating the variable with year information that will be used in faceting the plots, we grouped the year information provided in `review_date` into two year increments to create a new character variable (`year_even`) using the mutate function. We made this choice as 12 separate graphs (one for each year instead of for two years) would provide too much clutter, and it would be hard to visualize the trends across time. We also made a new variable, `avg_rating`, that stores the average rating for a cocoa percentage in a certain year by grouping the data by `year_even` and `cocoa_percentage`. For the plot, our x-axis variable is the cocoa percentage and the y-axis variable is the rating. The plot will be faceted into 6 time periods assigned within 2006 \\~ 2017. We created linear line graphs and scatterplots so we can see the overall trend of how ratings change as the cocoa percentage changes as well as some variation in the data, and we faceted by time periods how this relationship changed as time changed.\n\n### Analysis\n\n(2-3 code blocks, 2 figures, text/code comments as needed): In this section, provide the code that generates your plots.

Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.\n\nBased on the first plot, it can be seen that in general, as the percentage of cocoa increases, the ratings tend to decrease, indicating that people tend to prefer chocolate with less cocoa in it. However, this trend has lessened as time has progressed. In 2016-2017, there is no clear preference for chocolate with higher or lower cocoa percentages, but in 2006-2007, the data clearly indicates a preference for chocolate with lower cocoa percentage. Additionally, the data does not seem to contain much chocolate with less than 50% cocoa, as these chocolates only have data in 2010 to 2013. This may be an indication that chocolate companies produced more low cocoa chocolate during those years, but it could just be a lack of observations in this data set.\n",

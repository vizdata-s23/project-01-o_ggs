It contains 9 variables with 1795 observations. The data contain information about the company who makes the chocolate bars, the percent of cocoa, where the company is located, bean type & origin, and review (out of 5 stars). It comes from the kaggle data set, Chocolate Bar Ratings: Extensive EDA, by Will Canniford. The original data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/willcanniford/chocolate-bar-ratings-extensive-eda/data). Here is a small glimpse into what our data looks like.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(chocolate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 1,795\nColumns: 9\n$ company_maker_if_known           <chr> \"A.

We were especially intrigued by the dataset containing both time and geospatial data. We believe that this will allow us to make informative and visually pleasing graphics. We also all love chocolate.\n\n# Questions\n\nThese are the two questions we want to answer.\n\n1. What characteristics of the chocolate make up the most successful chocolate bar in reviews?\n\n2. How do expert reviews change over time for each company?\n\n# Analysis plan\n\n1. For the first question, we plan to utilize the variables (characteristic variables like `broad_bean_origin, specific_bean_origin_or_bar_name, bean_type, cocoa_percent, company_location`, and `bean_type`) that could effectively distinguish different groups of chocolate bars and graph them against the review ratings to better observe the relationship between the characteristics of chocolates bars and their ratings. In order to do this, we will create a new variables that represent the specific bean origin and the bar name respectively. \nThe `specific_bean_origin_or_bar_name` variable contains varying information and for certain values so we will need to split the character string to obtain the data needed. \n\n2. With regards to the second question, we will make use of the `review_date` on the x axis, `rating` on the y-axis, and company variables (`company_location` and `company_maker_if_known`) to observe how the expert reviews for different companies vary over time. Then using aesthetic parameters of fill and color with our company variables (listed above), we plan to gain a better understanding of what potential changes in characteristics have caused an upward or downward in the review ratings over time. \nIf time allows we hope to use our time series plot to potentially map and compare significant changes in chocolate bar `ratings` to significant world events in the industry at the time of the expert review. \n\nAt this time we do not believe we will need to add any external data to answer either question.\n",
